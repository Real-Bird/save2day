It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils; it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man.

    "97": "To like and dislike the same things, that is indeed true friendship.",
    "98": "Don't flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates.

    "113": "How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book.",
    "114": "The number of books will grow continually, and one can predict that a time will come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct study of the whole universe. It will be almost as convenient to search for some bit of truth concealed in nature as it will be to find it hidden away in an immense multitude of bound volumes.",

    "190": "To win without risk is to triumph without glory.",
    "191": "Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent's pressure, and the temporary failures.",
    "192": "I'd rather be a could - be if I cannot be an are; because a could - be is a maybe who is reaching for a star, I'd rather be a has - been than a might - have - been, by far; for a might have - been has never been, but a has was once an are.",

    "203": "The worst sin - perhaps the only sin - passion can commit, is to be joyless.",
    "204": "Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.",
    "205": "Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.",
